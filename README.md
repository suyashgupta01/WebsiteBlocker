# Website and redirecting 

This script modifies the hosts file to block/unblock websites and redirect/remove redirect to websites.
To run this program, use the .exe file in the 'executable' folder.

You may need to clear the browser cache or restart the system in some cases for the blocks/ redirects to come into effect.


Note:
  This will work only on Windows.
